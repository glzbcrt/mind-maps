# Mind Maps

I like a lot of mind maps. I think they help to better organize ideas and I have been creating some mind maps in the last year and now I am sharing them here. Maybe they might help someone else.

Please note that they are a working in progress.

To view them you need Xmind and you can download a free version here [http://www.xmind.net/](http://www.xmind.net/).
